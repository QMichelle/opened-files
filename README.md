 - foldernames in tabs was sourced out: [foldername-tabs](https://atom.io/packages/foldername-tabs)

## Features
 - Pinned tabs
 - Tree-view and list-view of opened files
 - Highlight tab on hover of file
 - Saves pinned tabs in project file (needs project-manager package)
 - works together with [color-tabs](https://atom.io/packages/color-tabs) and [color-picker-service](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker-service) to color individual tabs

## Known issues

 - needs a restart (`ctrl+alt+r`) when `color-tabs`/`color-picker-service` are added or removed at runtime
 - list view isn't sorted right now
